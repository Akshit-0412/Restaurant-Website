# Burger Shop Website

I've created a fully responsive frontend design for a burger shop's website. The website features all the essential details about the shop.

In addition, the website includes a table booking form, so anyone can easily reserve a table for there next visit. I've also highlighted the key features of the shop.

The menu is a major focus of the website, showcasing all the delicious food items they offer. I've organized the menu into clear categories, so it's easy to find what you're looking for. Each menu item includes a description and price.
